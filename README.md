## Requires macOS 11.0 or newer to succesfully build and test

Application uses @main wrapper and some other xcode 12.x and macOS 11.x features and doing so makes it uncompatible even with macOS 10.15

As of 26.03.21 no macOS 11.0 github actions runners are PUBLICLY available, so any CI job will probably fail
